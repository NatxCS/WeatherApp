# Flutter Weather App

A simple Flutter weather application that uses the OpenWeather API to provide weather information based on the user's location (**please create an apiKey and add it to weather.dart**). This project was inspired by a course on [The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/) where I learned about building apps with Flutter.

## Features

- Get current weather conditions based on user's location.
- Display temperature, weather description, and icon representing the weather.
- Request user's location permission to provide accurate weather data.
- Uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather information.
